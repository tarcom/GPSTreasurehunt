Get it on github

Find out to run locally with local db, or with aogj db

make db creation script including reset (truncate and create)


make the treasurehunt maker app (admin-mode)
*possible show one map with all treasures on as markers, with current position as center
*show list with treasure:
 - ID
 - name
 - description
 - picture
 - GPS coordination
 - static map (possible non-static)
   - satelite
   - possible with current position
   - zoom level is close

*last in list, is where you add more treasures OR a new page perhaps (new is more simple)
 - make the list page pretty static => simpler
 - when you save, page is reloaded and point is now added to the list and you may add a new

*make treasurehunt createion app
 - possible just below the treshure list
 - make a hunt defined by treasure ID, possible just a simple input field, where you add the ID's comma separated

 *make the actual tresureHunt app
  - possible very simple
  - shows GPS accuracy level (red yellow green...)
  - a picture of tresure
  - a button where you press I FOUND IT...
  - ok to press all you want
  - once found, goto next pic
