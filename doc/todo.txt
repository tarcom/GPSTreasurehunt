DONE: Get it on github

DONE: Find out to run locally with local db, or with aogj db

DONE: make db creation script including reset (truncate and create)


DONE: NOT-A-PROBLEM-RIGHT-NOW, will perhaps be if developing local to aogj db, so do not do that.: solve: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://localhost/geo/savePosition.php?name=yes%209&hint=use%20youre%20imagi…9&lat=57.0707729&lon=10.111310699999999&accuracy=20&imageUrl=56ca1f32ba963. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://192.168.0.92' is therefore not allowed access.

DONE: solve: auto-increment not working? always zero (0)

DONE: IT DOES WORK, (just use safari, not chrome on iphone. PC is a mystery. Not tested on android... This is weird!) solve: on phone, image is saved, but not db data
       on PC: db data is saved, but not image
       on phone: db data is saved, when no image is selected

solve: accuracy seems low (65meters), but when google maps are opened, it drops to 5 og 10 menters... then increases right after...

make the treasurehunt maker app (admin-mode)
*possible show one map with all treasures on as markers, with current position as center
*show list with treasure:
 - ID
 - name
 - description
 - picture
 - GPS coordination
 - static map (possible non-static)
   - satelite
   - possible with current position
   - zoom level is close

*last in list, is where you add more treasures OR a new page perhaps (new is more simple)
 - make the list page pretty static => simpler
 - when you save, page is reloaded and point is now added to the list and you may add a new

*make treasurehunt createion app
 - possible just below the treshure list
 - make a hunt defined by treasure ID, possible just a simple input field, where you add the ID's comma separated

 *make the actual tresureHunt app
  - possible very simple
  - shows GPS accuracy level (red yellow green...)
  - a picture of tresure
  - a button where you press I FOUND IT...
  - ok to press all you want
  - once found, goto next pic

Future ideas:

*password protect admin page...

*make iphone/android app

*perhaps use google as AUTH

*get rich
